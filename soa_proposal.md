# Proposal

## Infrastructure

- A separate repo is created to manage the event code and discussions.
- All discussions for the event are handled by github issues.
- Telegram/whatsapp can be used for small group discussions involving 2-3 people.
- We build the soa site with something like react/vue/jinja and deploy using netlify.
- The API server is built using python and hosted on heroku/free aws.
- Both codebases reside in the same repo for ease of versioning and hot updates during the event.

## Participant flow

- We rename the event to something else.
- We keep the event completely open, no fees and no limitations.
- Each participant is in one of three phases at any given time.
- Every time a participant finishes a phase, they are moved to the next phase.

### Phase 1 participants

- We set up a simple to follow tutorial for python/any other language we can support.
- This needs to be a 10 page setup MAX
- The idea is to be as lightweight as possible so that people want to keep coming back to the event and tell their friends about it.
- Use repl.it to set up the teaching IDE.
- Do basic concepts like math, lists, dict, loops, print/input
- Each concept / section has 2 questions as test. Once all tests are done the participant has cleared the phase.
- We can now give them links to python docs, practice sites etc. to read in their free time.

###  Phase 2 participants

- We shift them from repl.it to hackerrank/leetcode/hackerearth easy questions
- We provide them a few questions as practice along with tutorials for that.
- After that we give them a target. For example 5 start python on hackerrank or something else...
- In order to achieve that target participants are encouraged to ask questions in a group setting.
- We use github issues to manage these discussions. This preps them to use github for the next phase.

### Phase 3 participants

- We pick out 2-3 foss projects and mentor them into contributing to it.
- People get assigned foss projects.
- The group discussion philosophy is maintained, except this time there is at least one mentor present in the group.
- Our target is to make everyone who reaches here submit at least one PR in a FOSS project.
